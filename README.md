        - watched [Time Management Tips for Developers](https://youtu.be/QRVEuwOn6kI?si=3VB__Qh1yddI-nUu)
        - watched [How I Manage My Time - 10 Time Management Tips](https://youtu.be/iONDebHX9qk?si=erYfj2_GPUGR7bUb)
        - take away:
            1. Priority tasks by date due and how important they are
            2. Create a TODO list
            3. Drop small things when the TODO list builds up things which you havenâ€™t done in a certain amount of time
            4. Focus on big goals
            5. Tracking tasks
            6. Set a daily highlight which is one thing I am focusing on
            7. Schedule the daily highlight
            8. Block out time: set a time with a beginning time and an artificial deadline
            9. Set protected time: which is an uninterrupted time
        - consider to use time tracker
